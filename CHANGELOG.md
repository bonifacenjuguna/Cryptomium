# Changelog

## 1.0.1

- **Fix:** bot posted "Connected." but never posted coin data. In Telegraf 4.x
  `await bot.launch()` doesn't resolve while polling, so `startScheduler()` was
  never reached. Launch now resolves via the `onLaunch` callback.
- **Fix:** Binance fallback feed always failed (HTTP 400) because `USDTUSDT`
  isn't a real pair. Coins without a Binance pair are now skipped in the fallback.
- Log a line on every price tick (prices fetched, channel connected or not).
- Catch errors from `setMyCommands`; round the initial baseline to avoid float drift.

## 1.0.0

- Initial release.
